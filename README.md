Using pip üêç
Choose the installation option that best fits your needs:

Basic Installation
For basic web crawling and scraping tasks:

pip install crawl4ai

By default, this will install the asynchronous version of Crawl4AI, using Playwright for web crawling.

üëâ Note: When you install Crawl4AI, the setup script should automatically install and set up Playwright. However, if you encounter any Playwright-related errors, you can manually install it using one of these methods:

Through the command line:

playwright install
